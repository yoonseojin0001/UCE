이미지를 평가할 때 사용할 수 있는 프롬프트는 3가지 종류가 있습니다.
1) "{아티스트}" (CLIP에 저장된 아티스트에 대한 모든 정보를 의미함)
2) "An image in the style of {아티스트}" (CLIP에 저장된 아티스트 스타일 정보를 의미함)
3) "An image depicting {아티스트}" (CLIP에 저장된 아티스트 자체의 정보를 의미함)

#
평가 지표로 프롬프트 1, 3을 고른다면 이미지가 아티스트 스타일과 관련 있는지 없는지를 구분할 수 없습니다.
아티스트 스타일이 아니더라도 아티스트에 대한 정보를 가지고 있다면 점수가 높게 나오기 때문입니다.
따라서 프롬프트 2가 선택되어야 합니다.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
제공된 아티스트 중 CLIP에 관련 정보가 없는 경우가 있습니다.
그럴 경우 점수가 낮으며 전혀 관련 없는 이미지를 생성합니다.
이런 아티스트가 제거, 보존 프롬프트에 들어갔을 때 어떤 영향이 발생하는지 분석이 필요합니다.
